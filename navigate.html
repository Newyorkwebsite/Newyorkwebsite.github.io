			<h3>Transportation</h3>
			<p2> Subway, bus, taxi, car, tram, bike, ferry, helicopter or cruise. MTA- Subway and buses. If you can't walk to your destination, mass transit is the next-best way to get around. The City's rail and bus system is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and known as MTA New York City Transit. It's inexpensive, environmentally friendly and a great way to see sights throughout the five boroughsâ€”and it operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p2>
